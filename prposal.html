You were always the one who brought light into my life, and since you’ve been gone, it’s been dimmer. You are the love of my life, and not a day goes by that you’re not on my mind.

I want you to know that I’ve changed. I’ve grown and matured in ways that I didn’t think were possible. I’ve learned to appreciate what truly matters in life, and above all, I’ve learned to value the love and kindness of a good person li howa nti

I miss you, and if you’re willing, I would love the chance to show you the person I’ve become. A person who is ready to love, respect, and cherish you the way you deserve.

Please take your time to think about this. Know that my feelings for you are sincere and that my intentions are pure.
